Hi Everyone!

Emily here, I like archival work and hope to better understand how the digital humanities help the process while sharing the pleothora of knowledge thats boxed up on shelves in the massive storage room here at Florida State University's Institution of World War II and the Human Experience. I'm keen to learn more about coding (I'm coming in with zero expereince here) and utilize it in future research!
